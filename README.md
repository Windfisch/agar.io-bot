## Purpose
The purpose of this bot is to explore decision-making based on statistics instead of
hard-coded rules.  This is not a bot to enhance normal gameplay.  There's also no team-related features.  Considerations should be fairly simple and not need to consider more than one other organism at a time.  This effectly excludes any "advance" strategies.  The code is designed to be
"forked" easily so everything is kept at the bare necessities.  If you want to (for example)
create a better pathfinder, forking the code would be the best choice.
